Project information:

open-vm-tools <http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/>

	These are the release notes for the open-vm-tools.  Read them carefully, as
they explain how to build this project for different platforms and various 
different Linux distributions.

================================================================================
General information:

(*)What are the open-vm-tools? 
	The open-vm-tools are a subset of the VMware Tools, currently composed of
kernel modules for Linux and user-space programs for all VMware supported Unix
like guest operating systems.

(*)Where do I find documentation for the open-vm-tools beyond this README?
	Please refer to the main project web site for all the latest documentation 
at: <http://open-vm-tools.sourceforge.net/> 

(*)How do I build the open-vm-tools?
	The open-vm-tools uses the GNU Automake tool for generating Makefiles to 
build all sources.  More information about Automake can be found here: 
<http://sources.redhat.com/automake/>

For more information on building this project see the "Project build
information" section of this document. 

================================================================================
Project build information:

(*)Getting configure options & help:
	If you are looking for help or additional settings for the building of this
project the following configure command will display a list of help options:
	"./configure --help"

(*)Using configure:
	When using configure in the steps below it is only necessary to call
"./configure" once unless there was a problem after the first invocation.

(*)Building Unix user-space programs:
1) "./configure"
2) Run "make" to build Unix userland programs
3) Run "make modules" to build kernel modules

(*)Packaging:
If you are interested in creating a Tools package, please see
<https://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/open-vm-tools/index.php?title=Packaging>
for more information.

================================================================================
Build suggestions:
	Each Linux distribution puts binaries, libraries and development headers in 
different locations.  This leads to having to setup different paths for the
compiler and linker for the Automake system.  Below is a list of known
configurations to build for platforms that do not "just work" out of the box
or the tar-ball as the case may be.

General Build note:
	Please make note that the "--disable-multimon" flag should only be used when
there are no libXinerama libraries installed, or you do not want to enable multi
monitor support.

	Your operating system version will influence which kernel
modules can be built. Here are the minimum OS versions for each
module:

|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| vmsync        | vmblock        | vmxnet       | vmmemctl       | vmhgfs      |
|---------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|-------------|
| Linux 2.6.6   | Linux 2.4.0    | Linux 2.2.0  | Linux 2.2.0    | Linux 2.4.0 |
| FreeBSD N/A   | FreeBSD 6.0    | FreeBSD 4.9  | FreeBSD 3.2    |             |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

(*)Suse Enterprise 10.1 (i386 & x86_64):
i386:
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gnome/lib"

x86_64:
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/opt/gnome/lib64"

(*)OpenSolaris "Nevada" (i386 & x86_64):
	Before building open-vm-tools on Solaris, you will need to make 
sure that libdnet (http://libdnet.sourceforge.net/) is installed and 
that the 'dnet-config' script is on your shell's PATH.

	Make sure that the GNU tools are in your shell's PATH. The 
default GNU tools location on OpenSolaris is: "/usr/sfw/bin". Once the 
PATH is set in your build shell then the following configure command 
should work:

./configure --disable-multimon

(*)FreeBSD 6.2 (i386 & x86_64):
./configure LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"

================================================================================
Other resources:
	There are also open-source video & mouse drivers for Xorg/XFree86 that
provide better performance and additional features to Linux, Solaris, and BSD
derivatives guests running X11. 

	The drivers 'xf86-input-vmmouse' and 'xf86-video-vmware' are included with 
recent Xorg releases, and it shouldn't be necessary to do anything extra to 
obtain them.  If you want to obtain them separately, they can be downloaded at:
<http://xorg.freedesktop.org/releases/individual/driver/>
